We've already coded all the logic regarding the water in the thermos, but we still have no news about the mate. :unamused:

> Let's make a few small changes to our current program:
>
>  1. Initialize the variable `water_in_mate` to 0.
>  2. Modify the `pour_water` procedure so that, in addition to what it was already doing, it increases the `water_in_mate` by 30 milliliters.
>  3. Define the `drink_mate` procedure that leaves the mate water level at 0.
