To avoid :x: `NameError`s, before using a variable we have to give it an initial value, or in other words, _initialize it_.

> ðŸ›— Define a function `elevator_overloaded`, which takes a number of people and tells whether they all exceed the maximum load:
>
> ```python
> ãƒ elevator_overloaded(1)
False
> ãƒ elevator_overloaded(100)
True
> ```
>
> Oh, and what is the average weight of a person? And the maximum weight? For that we'll use two variables:
>
> * `average_person_weight_in_kilograms`, which is already initialized,
> * `maximum_load_in_kilograms` that you have to initialize in `300`
