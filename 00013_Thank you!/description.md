When we no longer want _mate_, we must say _thank you_. :relaxed:

To represent this manner, we are going to define the `i_pass` procedure that is not going to do anything. However, it will not be an empty procedure but rather it will be defined as follows:

```python
def i_pass():
  pass
```

> 1. `water_in_mate`
> 2. `water_in_thermos`
> 3. `pour_water()`
> 4. `mate_water`
> 5. `i_pass()`
> 6. `mate_water`
> 7. `water_in_thermos`
