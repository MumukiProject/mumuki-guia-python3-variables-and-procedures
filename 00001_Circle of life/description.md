_🦁 Here comes a <del>lion</del> lesson!_

In programming, we try to solve our problems with... programs :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. And among the problems that almost no one wants to solve are mathematical problems. Especially ones that involve numbers, like π - _pi_ -, with infinite decimal places that are impossible to remember :head_bandage:

> Considering the number pi equal to `3.14159265358979` (it is not infinite but precise enough for our calculations), define the functions `circle_perimeter` and `circle_area` that receive the radius of a circle and return its perimeter and its area respectively.
