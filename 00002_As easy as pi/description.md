Fortunately, there is a tool that will simplify our task from now on: the _variables_. :grin:

Variables allow us to name and reuse _values_, much like functions allow us to name and reuse solutions to smaller problems. For example, if we do...

``` python
first_month = "January"
```

...we are _assigning_ the value `"January"` to the variable `first_month`. In simple terms, we are giving that value to the variable. :relieved: Thereafter in our code we will be able to use `first_month` as a synonym of `"January"`:

```python
ãƒ first_month + " 1st"
"January 1st"
```
